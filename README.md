# Batcorder

Just a little holder to keep track of my forays into using Micropython on a Pi Pico- in the endgame I hope to have an ultrasonic recorder
for bats. Why not Audiomoth or Pipistrelle? Well, mainly practice- but also cost and/or functionality- having something I make myself and
can easily program myself seems like it'd be pretty nice. Plus I have to impress my lady! 

At the moment there's an SPI driver here for the IS62 SRAM Module written in Micropython with Byte/Page write/read, and an example on how
to use the sequential write/read with it. T.b.d is DMA with it, too- have to figure that out first, though!
